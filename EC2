# EC2 – Elastic Compute Cloud

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a service used to launch public virtual servers on AWS.  
It is elastic in nature, which means we can scale up or scale down the instance based on our requirements.

## Advantages

### Pay-as-you-go  
You only pay for what you use.

### Maintenance  
AWS handles hardware maintenance, upgrades, and security of the infrastructure.

---

## Instance Types (5 main categories)

- General Purpose  
- Compute Optimized  
- Memory Optimized  
- Storage Optimized  
- Accelerated Computing  

---

## Regions and Availability Zones

### Regions  
We launch EC2 instances in the region closest to users to reduce latency.

### Availability Zones (AZs)  
Each region has multiple AZs.  
If one AZ has an issue, another AZ can take over.  
This ensures high availability and reduces downtime.

## Usage

Applications are deployed inside EC2 instances.  
We can access EC2 from outside using:
- Public IP  
- Elastic IP  
- Load Balancer  
- Domain (Route 53)

EC2 works like a traditional server but hosted in the cloud.
