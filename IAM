## IAM – Identity and Access Management

IAM is a global AWS service used to manage authentication and authorization. It helps control access to AWS services in a secure and scalable way.

---

## 1. Authentication
Authentication verifies *who* is trying to access AWS.

Examples:
- Logging in with username + password  
- Using Access Key & Secret Key  
- Using MFA  

Authentication only confirms identity.  
Actual permissions depend on attached policies.

---

## 2. Authorization
Authorization defines *what actions* the user or service can perform.

Authorization is controlled using **IAM Policies**, which specify:
- Allowed or denied actions  
- Resources the actions apply to  
- Optional conditions (IP address, MFA, etc.)

---

# IAM COMPONENTS ::

## 1. Users
IAM Users represent **individual persons** who need access to AWS.

A user can have:
- AWS Console access  
- Programmatic access (CLI/SDK)  
- Or both  

Use case: Developers, testers, DevOps engineers.

---

## 2. Groups
Groups are collections of users.  
Permissions are attached to the group, and all users inherit those permissions.

Use case:  
Team-wise grouping like “Developers”, “Testers”, “Admins”

This improves consistency and reduces manual effort.

---

## 3. Policies
Policies are JSON documents that define permissions.

A policy contains:
- Effect: Allow / Deny  
- Action: Operations like `s3:GetObject`  
- Resource: ARNs of resources  
- Condition: Optional restrictions

Types of policies:
- AWS Managed Policies  
- Customer Managed Policies  
- Inline Policies  

---

## 4. Roles
Roles are **temporary identities** with permissions.  
They do not belong to an individual user.  
They are “assumed” when needed and provide temporary STS credentials.

Who can assume a role?
- AWS services (EC2, Lambda, ECS)  
- Users from same account  
- Users from another AWS account (cross-account)  
- Identity providers (SSO, AD, Okta)

Examples:
- An EC2 instance needs S3 access → attach an IAM Role  
- Lambda accessing DynamoDB  
- Cross-account admin access  

Roles improve security because no long-term access keys are required.

# Shared Responsibility Model

## What is the IAM Shared Responsibility Model?

AWS manages security *of* the cloud — hardware, data centers, and networking.  
We manage security *in* the cloud — IAM users, roles, policies, MFA, access permissions, encryption, and networking configurations.

---

# Best Practices
- Always enable MFA for privileged users  
- Follow the principle of least privilege  
- Use roles instead of long-term access keys  
- Rotate access keys regularly  
- Use groups instead of attaching policies directly to users
